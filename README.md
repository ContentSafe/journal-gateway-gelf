journal-gateway-zmtp
====================

A ZeroMQ gateway for sending logs from systemd's journald over the network and a sink (both CLI tools).

Logs are stored in a journalfile, separated for each source.

The following is the planned operation mode of the gateway.

The current state only supports forwarding via ZMTP.

Installation
------------

You will need [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) (recomended version: 3.2.5, you'll need >= 3), [czmq](https://github.com/zeromq/czmq#toc3-71)  (ZeroMQ C bindings), jansson and the systemd-headers (for the gateway only). The gateway and the client can be build seperately (thus you dont need systemd for the client). Using Fedora you can do:

```bash
yum install jansson jansson-devel systemd-devel
```

for jansson and systemd. To install ZMQ and CZMQ follow the instructions on  the linked sites.


Then just execute (in the journal-gateway-zmtp directory):

```bash
make              # you can also just build the gateway or the client 
                  # with 'make gateway' or 'make client' 

sudo make install	# puts the binaries to /usr/bin; 
                  # 'make source' or 'make sink' is also
                  # possible
sudo ldconfig
```

Usage
-----

### gateway-sink

You should start the sink first.
It binds to the specified socket and waits for an incomming connection from a gateway.
If you want it to stay listening for more than one connection, you should start it with the --listen flag.

You can start the sink via:
```bash
env JOURNAL_DIR=[journal directory] journal-gateway-zmtp-sink [options]
```
You must specify a directory in which you want to save your remote journals (set via environment variable JOURNAL_DIR).
The journal file names are based on the IDs of the gateways.
Every new gateway-sink connection will be logged in the journal:

```bash
MÃ¤r 02 09:58:42 virtual-fedora-sbs journal-gateway-zmtp-sink[9623]: gateway has a new source, ID: 006B8B4567
```

If you want to use this tool as a relay you need to store the received logs into the local journal directory:
```bash
env JOURNAL_DIR=/var/log/journal/[machine-id] journal-gateway-zmtp-sink
```

This way the gateway can access this journal files and will forward them to the next sink.

### gateway

Installing the gateway will also install a service file to execute the gateway as a systemd unit:

```bash
systemctl start journal-gateway-zmtp-source    # connects by default to "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"
```

If you need other sockets you can write a configuration file for the service:
The service looks for a configuration file named "zmq_gateway.conf" in the directory "~/conf". You can change the socket there (this only has an effect, if you execute the gateway as a systemd unit).

If you want to start the gateway without using systemd, you can type
```bash
env TARGET_ADDR=[sink adress] journal-gateway-zmtp-source
```
where [sink adress] is the exposed socket of the sink.

Use --help for an overview of all commands.

Example
-------

Start the sink:
```bash
env JOURNAL_DIR=~/logs/remote/ journal-gateway-zmtp-sink --listen 
```
Start the gateway:
```bash
env TARGET_ADDR=tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 journal-gateway-zmtp-source
```

This will write everything in your journal into a journal file in the specified directory.
You can check this by accessing this new file with journal control:
```bash
journalctl --file ~/logs/remote/[some id].journal
```
