test setup to check the major abbilities of the gateway:

start the source and the sink as systemd services (depending on the test case on different machines):

$systemctl start journal-gateway-zmtp-sink
$systemctl start journal-gateway-zmtp-source

start watching the output folder in the sink:
$journalctl --directory /path/to/output/ -f

start a continous stream of logs on the source (u can use the generate_logs script)

$./generate_logs

the stream of logs should now be visible in the target folder

use the control tool as wished, some configurations can be checked with the control_sample script

the stream should change accordingly
